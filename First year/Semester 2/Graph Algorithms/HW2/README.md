Assigned problems

1. Write a program that, given a directed graph and two vertices, finds a lowest length path between them, by using a forward breadth-first search from the starting vertex.

2. Write a program that, given a directed graph and two vertices, finds a lowest length path between them, by using a backward breadth-first search from the ending vertex.

3. Write a program that finds the connected components of an undirected graph using a depth-first traversal of the graph.

4. Write a program that finds the connected components of an undirected graph using a breadth-first traversal of the graph.
