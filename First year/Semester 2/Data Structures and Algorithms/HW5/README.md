# Lab 5: Binary Search Tree
Implement in C++ the given container (ADT) using a given representation and a binary search 
tree (BST) as a data structure. You are not allowed to use any container or data structure from STL or from any other library.

Do not implement a separate class for the binary search tree (or for the dynamic array), 
implement the container directly!

12. ADT SortedMultiMap â€“ using a BST with linked representation on an array. In the BST (key, 
value) pairs are stored. If a key has multiple values, it appears in multiple pairs
