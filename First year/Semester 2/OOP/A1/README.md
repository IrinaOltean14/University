## Requirements
- Write a **C application** (not C++!) with a menu based console interface which solves one of the problems below. 
- Menu entries are expected for: 
    - reading a vector of numbers from the console,
    - solving each of the 2 required functionalities,
    - exiting the program.

- Provide specifications for all functions.


3.	**a.** Print the Pascal triangle of dimension `n` of all combinations `C(m,k)` of m objects taken by `k, k = 0, 1, ..., m`, for line `m, where m = 1, 2, ..., n`.\
**b.** Given a vector of numbers, find the longest contiguous subsequence of prime numbers.
