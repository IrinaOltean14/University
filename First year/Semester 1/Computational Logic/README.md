## Optional homework - implementation operations + conversions

The application must implement algorithms for: 
- arithmetic operations for positive integers: addition, suntraction, multimplication and division by one digit in base p = 2, 3, ..., 9, 10, 16
-	 conversions of natural numbers between two bases p,q -> {2,3,...,9,10,16} using the substitution method or successive divisions and rapid conversions between two bases p,q -> {2, 4, 8, 16}.
and must have a menu such that all operations and conversion methods to be verified separately.
